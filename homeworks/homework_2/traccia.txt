First part
Explain the concept of dataset and distribution.
Using a DBMS create a simple dataset and compute the k univariate distribution (k <= 3)

For champions: compute a bivariate (choosing 2 variables)

Second part
Take a text and compute 
	- the distribution of the letters
	- apply a Caesar Cipher
	- Decode the encrypted text (assuming now that you don't know the start)
	- Decode using the "language distribution"
