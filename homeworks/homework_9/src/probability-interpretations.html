    <h1>Interpretations of Probability and Their Conceptual Inconsistencies</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <article>
        <p>
            The notion of <em>probability</em> has historically been subject to multiple interpretations, each grounded
            in intuitive reasoning yet affected by conceptual and operational limitations. This section analyzes the
            main schools of thought and the inconsistencies that arise when they are applied.
        </p>

        <h2>The Classical Interpretation (A Priori Probability)</h2>
        <p>
            The classical interpretation, formalized by Laplace, defines the probability of an event \(E\) as the
            ratio between the number of favorable outcomes \(m\) and the total number of possible outcomes \(n\):
        </p>
        <p class="formula">\[ P(E) = \frac{m}{n} \]</p>

        <p><strong>Fundamental Assumption: The Principle of Indifference</strong></p>
        <p>
            This principle states that when no information distinguishes the possible outcomes, they should all be
            assigned equal probability. For example, each face of a fair die has probability \(1/6\).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tautology:</strong> It assumes equiprobability in order to define probability.</li>
            <li><strong>Inapplicability:</strong> It fails for infinite sample spaces or non-uniform scenarios (e.g., a loaded die).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Frequentist Interpretation (A Posteriori Probability)</h2>
        <p>
            The frequentist approach, promoted by von Mises, overcomes classical limitations by linking
            probability to experimental and objective facts. The probability of an event is defined as the limiting value of
            its relative frequency \(f_n(E)\) as the number of trials grows:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">\[ P(E) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(E) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{k}{n} \]</p>

        <p>
            This is an "a posterior" definition, because the probability value is determined only after the experimentation.
            The approach requires that the random experiment could be hypotetically repeated to infinity in the same conditions.
            The probability is considered as an objective and inherent feature of the physical system analyzed.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ambiguity in the notion of “identical conditions”.</li>
            <li>Inability to assign probabilities to single, non-repeatable events.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Subjective (Bayesian) Interpretation</h2>
        <p>
            The subjective interpretation, associated with Bruno de Finetti and L.J. Savage, adopts a radically different perspective.
            According to de Finetti, probability "does not exist" objectively as a property of the real world.
        </p>

        <h3>Definition and Nature</h3>
        <p>
            Probability is a measure of the degree of belief (or subjective confidence) that a rational agent assigns
            to the occurrence of an event, given their state of knowledge. This is an "epistemological" view,
            where probability quantifies the observer's uncertainty. This interpretation allows assigning probabilities
            to unique, non-repeatable events.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bayesian inference relies on updating this degree of belief. Starting from a prior probability (the initial belief)
            and observing new data, Bayes' theorem is used to compute a posterior probability (the updated belief).
        </p>

        <h3>Limitations of the Subjective Approach</h3>
        <p>
            The main criticism of this approach lies in the apparent arbitrariness of choosing the prior probability.
            Although Bayesian proponents have developed methods for selecting "non-informative" priors,
            dependence on an initial estimate remains a philosophical point of debate.
        </p>

        <h2>Conceptual Incoherence: Bertrand’s Paradox (Geometric Probability)</h2>
        <p>
            Applying classical probability (based on the Principle of Indifference) to continuous (uncountably infinite) spaces
            leads to blatant inconsistencies. Bertrand’s Paradox (1889) is a classic example of this failure.
        </p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
            "Draw a chord randomly in a circle. What is the probability that this chord is longer than the side of an
            equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The paradox arises because the term "randomly" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in at least three different ways,
            each seemingly valid under the Principle of Indifference, but yielding different results.
        </p>

        <h3>The Three Inconsistent Solutions</h3>

        <h4>Method 1: Random Endpoints</h4>
        <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Fix a point \(A\) on the circumference (a vertex of the triangle). Choose another point \(B\) randomly on the circumference to define the chord.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The triangle side subtends an arc of 120°. For the chord to be longer, point \(B\) must fall on the opposite arc, which also measures 120°. The total circumference is 360°.</p>
        <p><strong>Probability:</strong>
            \[
            P = \frac{120}{360} = \frac{1}{3}
            \]
        </p>

        <h4>Method 2: Random Radius</h4>
        <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Fix a radius of the circle. Choose a point \(M\) randomly along this radius. Draw the chord perpendicular to the radius passing through \(M,\) where \(M\) is the midpoint of the chord.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Let \(R\) be the radius. The triangle side’s midpoint is at a distance \(R/2\) from the center. For the chord to be longer, \(M\) must fall in the segment from the center to \(R/2\). Assuming a uniform distribution along the radius, the "favorable length" is \(R/2\), and the "possible length" is \(R\).</p>
        <p><strong>Probability:</strong>
            \[
            P = \frac{R/2}{R} = \frac{1}{2}
            \]
        </p>

        <h4>Method 3: Random Midpoint</h4>
        <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Choose a point \(M\) randomly within the area of the circle. This point is the midpoint of the chord.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> All chords whose midpoints fall within a smaller concentric circle (inscribed in the triangle) are longer than the triangle’s side. The radius of this inscribed circle is \(r = R/2\). The "favorable area" is \(\text{Area}(r) = \pi(R/2)^2 = \frac{\pi R^2}{4}\), while the "possible area" is \(\text{Area}(R) = \pi R^2\).</p>
        <p><strong>Probability:</strong>
            \[
            P = \frac{\text{Area}(r)}{\text{Area}(R)} = \frac{\pi R^2 / 4}{\pi R^2} = \frac{1}{4}
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            The existence of three distinct answers (\(1/3\), \(1/2\), \(1/4\)) for the same problem, all derived from an apparently correct application of the Principle of Indifference, demonstrates that intuitive definitions of probability are insufficient. They fail to provide a rigorous and unambiguous mathematical framework for managing uncertainty, especially in infinite contexts.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>
            These inconsistencies reveal that intuitive interpretations are insufficient. A rigorous mathematical
            foundation is required — which is introduced by Kolmogorov’s axiomatic system.
