    <h1>Interpretations of Probability and Their Conceptual Inconsistencies</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <article>
        <p>
            The notion of <em>probability</em> has historically been subject to multiple interpretations, each grounded
            in intuitive reasoning yet affected by conceptual and operational limitations. This section analyzes the
            main schools of thought and the inconsistencies that arise when they are applied.
        </p>

        <h4>1.1 The Classical Interpretation (A Priori Probability)</h4>
        <p>
            The classical interpretation, formalized by Laplace, defines the probability of an event \(E\) as the
            ratio between the number of favorable outcomes \(m\) and the total number of possible outcomes \(n\):
        </p>
        <p class="formula">\[ P(E) = \frac{m}{n} \]</p>

        <p><strong>Fundamental Assumption: The Principle of Indifference</strong></p>
        <p>
            This principle states that when no information distinguishes the possible outcomes, they should all be
            assigned equal probability. For example, each face of a fair die has probability \(1/6\).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tautology:</strong> It assumes equiprobability in order to define probability.</li>
            <li><strong>Inapplicability:</strong> It fails for infinite sample spaces or non-uniform scenarios (e.g., a loaded die).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>1.2 The Frequentist Interpretation (A Posteriori Probability)</h4>
        <p>
            The frequentist approach, associated with von Mises, overcomes classical limitations by linking
            probability to empirical frequencies. The probability of an event is defined as the limiting value of
            its relative frequency \(f_n(E)\) as the number of trials grows:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">\[ P(E) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(E) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{k}{n} \]</p>

        <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ambiguity in the notion of “identical conditions”.</li>
            <li>Inability to assign probabilities to single, non-repeatable events.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>1.3 The Subjective (Bayesian) Interpretation</h4>
        <p>
            The subjective interpretation views probability as a rational degree of belief assigned by an agent,
            following authors such as de Finetti and Savage. Probability measures epistemic uncertainty and is
            updated using Bayes’ rule in light of new evidence.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Limitation</strong></p>
        <p>
            The main criticism concerns the apparent arbitrariness of choosing the prior distribution, although
            Bayesian theory provides tools for constructing non-informative priors.
        </p>

        <h4>1.4 Conceptual Incoherence: Bertrand’s Paradox (Geometric Probability)</h4>
        <p>
            Applying the Principle of Indifference to continuous spaces leads to contradictions such as Bertrand’s
            paradox. The probability that a randomly drawn chord in a circle is longer than the side of an inscribed
            equilateral triangle yields three incompatible answers depending on how “random” is defined:
            \(1/3\), \(1/2\), and \(1/4\).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion of the Module</strong></p>
        <p>
            These inconsistencies reveal that intuitive interpretations are insufficient. A rigorous mathematical
            foundation is required — which is introduced by Kolmogorov’s axiomatic system.
