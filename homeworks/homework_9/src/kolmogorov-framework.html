    <h1>The Axiomatic Solution — Kolmogorov's Unifying Framework</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <article>
        <h2>Kolmogorov’s Contribution (1933)</h2>
        <p>
            Kolmogorov did not attempt to define what probability <em>is</em>, but rather how it must behave. His
            axiomatic system separates mathematical structure from philosophical interpretation, giving probability
            a rigorous foundation within measure theory.
        </p>

        <h2>The Probability Space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\)</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>$\Omega$ (Omega) – Sample Space:</strong> This is the non-empty set of all possible elementary outcomes ($\omega$) of a random experiment. For example, for a die roll, $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>$\mathcal{F}$ (F) – Sigma-Algebra of Events:</strong> This is a family of subsets of $\Omega$ that defines which subsets are considered measurable "events," i.e., sets to which it is meaningful to assign a probability. $\mathcal{F}$ must satisfy specific mathematical properties.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>$P$ (P) – Probability Measure:</strong> This is a function $P: \mathcal{F} \to [0,1]$ that assigns a real number (the probability) to each event $A$ in the sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}$.
        </p>

        <h2>Kolmogorov’s Axioms</h2>

        <p><strong>Axiom 1 (Non-negativity):</strong> \(P(A) \ge 0\).</p>
        <p><strong>Axiom 2 (Normalization):</strong> \(P(\Omega) = 1\).</p>
        <p><strong>Axiom 3 (\(\sigma\)-additivity):</strong></p>
        <p class="formula">
            \[
            P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right)
            = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)
            \qquad\text{for disjoint } A_i.
            \]
        </p>

        <h2>Resolving the Bertrand Paradox with the Axiomatic Approach</h2>

        <p>
            The axiomatic approach does not "resolve" the philosophical debate between objectivists and subjectivists.
            A frequentist and a Bayesian will assign $P$ differently (the former via limits of relative frequencies, the latter
            via subjective beliefs), yet both must adhere to the same axioms to perform consistent calculations.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the case of Bertrand’s Paradox, Kolmogorov’s framework does not provide a single "correct" answer.
            Instead, it shows that the original problem was ill-posed. The inconsistency arose from the ambiguity of the
            phrase "at random." By using the axiomatic approach $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$, the analyst is required
            to define the probability measure $P$ explicitly.
        </p>

        <p>
            The three previously obtained "solutions" ($1/3$, $1/2$, $1/4$) are not contradictory.
            They are simply the correct results of three different experiments, i.e., three different choices of
            the probability measure $P$, each formalizing a distinct mechanism for generating the chord:
        </p>

        <p><strong>$P = 1/3$:</strong> Corresponds to a uniform measure $P_1$ over the angles (or arc lengths).</p>
        <p><strong>$P = 1/2$:</strong> Corresponds to a uniform measure $P_2$ over the radial distance from the center.</p>
        <p><strong>$P = 1/4$:</strong> Corresponds to a uniform measure $P_3$ over the area of the circle.</p>

        <p>
            The axiomatization shifts the problem from an ambiguous philosophical question ("what is random?")
            to rigorous mathematical modeling ("which probability measure $P$ are we using?").
        </p>
