        <h2>Measure-Theoretic Context: A Normalized Measure Space</h2>
        <p>
            Measure theory concerns the assignment of a "volume" or "size" (a measure) to subsets of a space.
            A measure space is a triple \((X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)\), where \(X\) is a set, \(\mathcal{A}\) is a
            \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(X\), and \(\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, \infty]\) is a \(\sigma\)-additive measure.
            A probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\) is a special case of a measure space where
            \(\Omega = X\), \(\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{A}\), and the measure \(P = \mu\) is normalized, i.e., \(P(\Omega) = 1\).
        </p>

        <h2>The \(\sigma\)-Algebra \(\mathcal{F}\)</h2>
        <p>
            In an uncountable space \(\Omega\), the set of <em>all</em> subsets (\(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\), the power set) is too large.
            It has been shown (e.g., via the Vitali construction) that no measure (like length or probability) can be \(\sigma\)-additive
            and consistent on all subsets without leading to paradoxes.
            The \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{F}\) solves this problem. It is a collection of "well-behaved" subsets (measurable events)
            to which we can legitimately assign probabilities.
        </p>

        <h3>Formal Definition of a \(\sigma\)-Algebra</h3>
        <p>
            A family \(\mathcal{F}\) of subsets of \(\Omega\) is a \(\sigma\)-algebra if it satisfies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The entire space is included: \(\Omega \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
            <li>Closed under complementation: If \(A \in \mathcal{F}\), then \(A^c \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
            <li>Closed under countable unions: If \(A_1, A_2, \dots \in \mathcal{F}\), then \(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            From these properties, it follows that \(\mathcal{F}\) contains the empty set \(\emptyset\) and is also closed under countable intersections.
            The pair \((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\) is called a measurable space.
        </p>

        <h2>The Probability Measure \(P\)</h2>
        <p>
            According to the axioms, \(P\) is a \(\sigma\)-additive function defined on the \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{F}\) that assigns
            a real number (the probability) to each event \(A \in \mathcal{F}\), with \(P(\Omega) = 1\).
        </p>

        <h2>Random Variables as Measurable Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Informally, a random variable is a number whose value depends on chance (e.g., the outcome of a die roll).
            In measure-theoretic terms, this concept is formalized rigorously.
        </p>
        <p>
            A random variable \(X\) is a function \(X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) that maps each elementary outcome \(\omega \in \Omega\) to a real number \(X(\omega)\).
