        <p>
            Probability theory offers a structured framework to reason about uncertainty
            and to quantify the likelihood of events in diverse contexts. Over the years,
            several interpretations of probability have been developed—classical, frequentist,
            Bayesian, and geometric—each providing valuable insights but also posing potential
            conceptual ambiguities when viewed in isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The axiomatic approach, pioneered by Kolmogorov, provides a unified and consistent
            foundation, resolving these ambiguities and allowing for rigorous treatment of
            probabilistic phenomena. This approach is deeply intertwined with measure theory,
            introducing key constructs such as sigma-algebras, probability measures, and
            measurable functions, which together enable a precise definition of random variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this context, we explore the fundamental properties of probability, including
            subadditivity and the inclusion–exclusion principle, and illustrate how the
            axiomatic framework ensures clarity and coherence across various interpretations,
            establishing a solid foundation for advanced studies in probability and statistics.
