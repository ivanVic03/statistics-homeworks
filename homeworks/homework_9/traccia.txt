Review the main interpretations of probability (classical, frequentist, Bayesian, geometric, etc.) and explain how the
axiomatic approach resolves conceptual inconsistencies among them.
Explain the relationship between probability theory and measure theory (sigma-algebras, probability measures, measurable
functions, random variables). Using the axioms of probability, derive the subadditivity property and the inclusion–exclusion principle.
