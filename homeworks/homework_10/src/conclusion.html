        <h2>The Approximated Stochastic Process</h2>
        <p>
            The simulation analyzes the <strong>Poisson Limit Theorem</strong>, which states that a <strong>Binomial distribution</strong>, $Bin(n, p)$, converges to a <strong>Poisson distribution</strong> as $n \to \infty$ (the number of trials) and $p \to 0$ (the probability of success) such that the mean $\lambda = n \times p$ remains constant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our simulation is a <strong>$Binomial(n, \lambda/n)$</strong> process. Here, we have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A large number of subintervals, $n$.</li>
            <li>A small probability of success in each interval, $p_{sub} = \lambda/n$.</li>
            <li>A constant mean, $n \times p_{sub} = n \times (\lambda/n) = \lambda$.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This process is a discrete-time approximation of the <strong>Homogeneous Poisson Process (HPP)</strong>. The HPP is a continuous-time stochastic process that counts the number of "events" (or "successes") that occur in a given time interval.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final count $K$ generated by our $Binomial(n, \lambda/n)$ simulation is a single random draw from a distribution that <em>approximates</em> $Poisson(\lambda)$. The graph is a <strong>realization</strong> of this discrete-time approximation.

        <h2>Theoretical Properties</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Poisson Process</strong> $N(t)$, which our simulation approximates, is defined by the following theoretical properties:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Counting Starts at Zero:</strong> The count of events at time $t=0$ is zero.
                <br>
                \( N(0) = 0 \)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Independent Increments:</strong> The number of events in non-overlapping time intervals are independent random variables.
                <br>
                <em>(e.g., the number of events in $[0, 2]$ is independent of the number of events in $[3, 5]$).</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stationary Increments:</strong> The probability distribution of the number of events in any interval depends only on the <em>length</em> of the interval, not its location.
                <br>
                \( P(N(t+s) - N(t) = k) \) depends only on $s$.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Poisson Distribution:</strong> The number of events in any interval of length $t$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda t$.
                <br>
                \( P(N(t) = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda t} (\lambda t)^k}{k!} \)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rarity of Events:</strong> In a very small time interval $\Delta t$, the probability of more than one event occurring is negligible (goes to zero faster than $\Delta t$). The probability of one event is approximately $\lambda \Delta t$.
                <br>
                \( P(N(t+\Delta t) - N(t) = 1) \approx \lambda \Delta t \)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Our $Binomial(n, \lambda/n)$ simulation explicitly models this last property. Our small interval is $\Delta t = 1/n$, so the probability of one event is exactly $p_{sub} = \lambda/n = \lambda \Delta t$.
        </p>

    <div class="analysis-section">
        <h2>Interpretation of the Rate Parameter &lambda;</h2>
        <p>
            The parameter <strong>$\lambda$ (lambda)</strong> is the <strong>average rate</strong> or <strong>intensity</strong> of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its interpretation is "the expected number of events per unit of time." In our simulation, the total time interval is $T=1$, so $\lambda$ is simply:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>$\lambda$ = The expected total number of events in the entire interval $[0, 1]$.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If our final count $K=5$, and the calculated $\lambda=4.8$, this is consistent. $\lambda$ is not the number of events that will happen (that is $K$), but the average number of events we would expect to see if we ran the simulation many, many times.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the context of the Poisson distribution $Poisson(\lambda)$, the parameter $\lambda$ is both the <strong>mean</strong> and the <strong>variance</strong> of the distribution. This means that if we were to run our $Binomial(n, \lambda/n)$ simulation many times and plot a histogram of the final $K$ counts, that histogram would approximate a Poisson distribution with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mean \( E[K] = \lambda \)</li>
            <li>Variance \( Var(K) = \lambda \)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Therefore, $\lambda$ is the single most important parameter, as it defines the central tendency and the spread of the resulting count distribution.
