    <h1>Comparison and Mathematical Analysis of Bernoulli Simulations</h1>

    <section>
        <p>
            This analysis explores the analogies and differences between two simulations based on Bernoulli processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            HW4 illustrated the <strong>Law of Large Numbers (LLN)</strong> through multiple trajectories of success/failure outcomes,
            tracking how the relative frequency of successes stabilizes around the theoretical probability \( p \) as the number of trials \( n \) increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            HW7 models the cumulative score of attackers attempting to breach a server over several weeks,
            assigning \( +1 \) for a secure week and \( -1 \) for a breach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, we study how the distribution of final scores evolves and how the trajectories behave analogously to a random walk.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Random Walk Analogy and Trajectories</h2>
        <p>
            Both simulations can be represented as <em>random walks</em>. In HW4, each trajectory represents a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials:
            \[
            X_i =
            \begin{cases}
            1, & \text{if the trial is a success} \\
            0, & \text{if the trial is a failure}
            \end{cases}
            \]
            and the relative frequency after \( n \) trials is
            \[
            f_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i.
            \]
            In HW7, the cumulative score trajectory of an attacker is:
            \[
            S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i, \quad
            Y_i =
            \begin{cases}
            +1, & \text{if the server is secure} \\
            -1, & \text{if breached}
            \end{cases}
            \]
            where \( n \) is the number of weeks and \( m \) the number of attackers. Despite differences in interpretation, both are discrete-time stochastic processes with independent increments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphically, HW4 trajectories converge toward \( p \), illustrating the LLN, whereas HW7 trajectories fluctuate around the expected cumulative score \( \mathbb{E}[S_n] = n(1 - 2p) \), showing how cumulative sums of independent Bernoulli variables tend to approximate a binomial distribution.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Binomial Coefficients and Pascal’s Triangle</h2>
        <p>
            In both assignments, the underlying probability distributions are described by the <strong>binomial distribution</strong>:
            \[
            P(S_n = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}.
            \]
            Pascal’s triangle provides an intuitive way to visualize these coefficients. Each row corresponds to the possible outcomes of \( n \) independent Bernoulli trials:
        <ul>
            <li>HW4: Counts the number of successes \( k \) across trajectories, forming a histogram approaching the binomial shape.</li>
            <li>HW7: Counts the final cumulative scores \( S_n \), which can be transformed into equivalent success counts if we map \(-1 \to 0\) and \(+1 \to 1\).</li>
        </ul>
        Therefore, both experiments are manifestations of the same combinatorial structure, though interpreted differently.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Visualizing Pascal’s Triangle and Fibonacci Connections</h2>
        <p>
            Pascal’s triangle not only encodes binomial coefficients, but also reveals hidden patterns such as Fibonacci numbers.
            The table below shows the first 7 rows, with the shallow diagonals summing to Fibonacci numbers highlighted in <span class="fib-diagonal">blue</span>.
        </p>

        <div id="pascalsTriangle" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; font-family: monospace;">
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><span>1</span></div>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><span>1</span>&nbsp;<span>1</span></div>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><span>1</span>&nbsp;<span>2</span>&nbsp;<span>1</span></div>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><span>1</span>&nbsp;<span>3</span>&nbsp;<span>3</span>&nbsp;<span>1</span></div>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><span>1</span>&nbsp;<span class="fib-diagonal">4</span>&nbsp;<span class="fib-diagonal">6</span>&nbsp;<span class="fib-diagonal">4</span>&nbsp;<span>1</span></div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The sums along these highlighted diagonals correspond to the Fibonacci numbers:
            \[
            F_1 = 1, \quad F_2 = 1, \quad F_3 = 2, \quad F_4 = 3, \quad F_5 = 5, \quad F_6 = 8, \dots
            \]
            This visualization shows concretely how combinatorial patterns emerge from sequences of independent trials in Bernoulli processes.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Comparison of Histogram Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Both HW4 and HW7 produce histograms of final outcomes. In HW4, the histogram shows the distribution of relative frequencies of successes, clustering around \( p \) as \( n \) increases.
            In HW7, the histogram shows the distribution of cumulative scores. As \( m \) and \( n \) increase, the histogram approximates the binomial shape:
            \[
            \text{Number of trajectories with final score } k \approx \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}.
            \]
            This demonstrates convergence to theoretical probabilities and provides an excellent visual analogy between the two experiments.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Both simulations exemplify discrete stochastic processes governed by Bernoulli trials.
            HW4 emphasizes relative frequencies and the Law of Large Numbers, while HW7 emphasizes cumulative outcomes and random walks.
            Their mathematical underpinnings — binomial coefficients, Pascal’s triangle, combinatorial identities, and even Fibonacci numbers — are shared, highlighting how fundamental combinatorial structures manifest in probability theory.
            Comparing both allows a deeper understanding of convergence, randomness, and the combinatorial foundations of stochastic simulations.
