        Statistical thinking is not merely an abstract concept; it is a practical tool used on the front lines of digital defense. Below are key roles where statistics plays a defining role.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Network Security Analyst:</strong> Applies statistical and probability analysis to identify anomalies in network traffic, leveraging linear algebra to develop advanced detection models.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptographer:</strong> Employs algebra and number theory to create encryption algorithms and uses probability to evaluate their resilience against attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Operations Center (SOC) Specialist:</strong> Uses rapid statistical reasoning to prioritize alerts and make real-time triage decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning Engineer:</strong> Builds automated models using calculus and linear algebra to predict and neutralize cyber threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This distribution of statistical expertise across various roles creates a multi-layered, data-driven defense posture where threat intelligence is generated, validated, and acted upon with mathematical precision.
