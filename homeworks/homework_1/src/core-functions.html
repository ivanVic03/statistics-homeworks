    <p>
        The true value of statistics in cybersecurity lies in its ability to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. Instead of simply reacting to alerts, a statistically-informed approach allows organizations to understand, quantify, and anticipate threats before they escalate.
    </p>

    <h3>Anomaly Detection and Pattern Recognition</h3>
    <p>
        Statistical analysis is fundamental to monitoring network logs and data streams for signs of compromise. By establishing a statistical baseline of normative network behavior, models can automatically identify unusual patterns and anomalies that deviate from this norm.
    </p>
    <p>
        These deviations might signal malicious activities such as data exfiltration or a denial-of-service attack. Contemporary intrusion detection systems depend heavily on these statistical models to spot anomalies in real-time.
    </p>

    <h3>Predictive Threat Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Probability and statistics are critical for forecasting future threats. By analyzing historical data and identifying recurring patterns, security systems can gain crucial insights into the probability of potential attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Machine learning algorithms—built upon sophisticated statistical models—now forecast attacks and strengthen preemptive measures, marking a shift from reactive to predictive defense.
    </p>
    <h3>2.3 Quantitative Risk Assessment</h3>
    <p>
        Cybersecurity is, at its core, a "risk calculation business." Statistical techniques move decision-making from intuition to evidence. Using formulas such as <strong>(probability × loss)</strong>, professionals can assess the potential impact of threats and allocate resources efficiently.
