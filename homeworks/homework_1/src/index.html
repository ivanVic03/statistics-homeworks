    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        As attackers leverage increasingly sophisticated, mathematically-based techniques, the cybersecurity field must evolve from a reactive posture to a proactive, mathematically-informed approach. The digital landscape is no longer a place where defense can be passive; it requires a deep understanding of the principles that govern both attacks and defenses.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this environment, a solid grasp of statistical concepts is no longer just an advantage but a fundamental necessity for anticipating and neutralizing modern digital threats.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the context of cybersecurity, statistics is the practice of analyzing large sets of digital data and network traffic to identify patterns, predict threats, and assess risk. By applying statistical principles, security professionals transform raw, unstructured data into a clear, quantifiable understanding of their security posture.
