            Measures of central tendency—such as the arithmetic, geometric, weighted, harmonic, and quadratic means—are
            fundamental tools for summarizing data. Each captures a different notion of “average,” suited to specific
            data structures and analytical goals. Understanding how and when to use them allows analysts to move from
            mere calculation to meaningful interpretation.
