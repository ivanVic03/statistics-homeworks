            <h2>Introduction: Understanding the "Average"</h2>
            <p>In the world of data analysis, the "average" or arithmetic mean, is often the first tool we reach for. It serves as an intuitive starting point in descriptive statistics, providing a quick measure of a dataset's central tendency. This initial step is an essential part of interpreting data in any field, from finance to healthcare.</p>

            <p>However, choosing a mean is a strategic decision that shapes the entire narrative of your data. While the arithmetic mean is a powerful starting point, understanding its nuances — and knowing when to use alternatives like the geometric or weighted mean — can reveal powerful insights into more complex trends and patterns. A one-size-fits-all approach can lead to misleading conclusions; this module explores the unique strengths and ideal applications of these three fundamental statistical tools to help you tell a more accurate story.</p>

            <p>We begin with the arithmetic mean to understand its properties and limitations before moving to the more specialized counterparts.</p>

            <h2>The Foundational Tool: The Arithmetic Mean</h2>
            <p>The arithmetic mean is the most common and intuitive measure of central tendency. It's the quantity most people mean when they say "average." Understanding its core properties and ideal applications is a critical skill for anyone working with data, as it forms the bedrock for more complex analyses.</p>

            <h3>What is the Arithmetic Mean?</h3>
            <p>The arithmetic mean is defined as the sum of all numbers in a dataset divided by the count of those numbers. Formally, for values \(x_1,\dots,x_n\),</p>
            <p>\[ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \]</p>

            <h3>Evaluating Its Key Properties</h3>
            <p>A critical property of the arithmetic mean is its sensitivity to outliers. Extreme values in a dataset can significantly pull the mean, potentially leading to misleading interpretations in skewed distributions.</p>

            <p class="note">Example: consider annual salaries \{30,000; 35,000; 40,000; 45,000; 1,000,000\}. The arithmetic mean is 230,000 — a value that does not reflect the typical employee's salary but signals the presence of an extreme outlier that merits further investigation.</p>

            <h3>When to Use It</h3>
            <p>Use the arithmetic mean for additive processes and datasets without extreme skew. Typical domains include finance (average expenses), economics (household consumption), and healthcare (average recovery times).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Accounting for Compounding and Growth: The Geometric Mean</h2>
            <p>For multiplicative processes — such as investment returns or growth rates — the geometric mean is the appropriate central measure. It captures the effect of compounding that the arithmetic mean misses.</p>

            <h3>Geometric vs. Arithmetic</h3>
            <p>Consider returns of +50% and −50%. The arithmetic mean suggests 0% (no change), but the geometric mean, computed via multipliers, correctly indicates a negative average growth rate.</p>

            <p>The geometric mean is \[ G = \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \dots x_n} \]</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Assigning Importance: The Weighted Mean</h2>
            <p>The weighted mean allows differing importance per observation. Compute it by multiplying each observation by its weight, summing, and dividing by the sum of weights:</p>
            <p>For weighted data, use \[ \bar{x}_w = \frac{\sum w_i x_i}{\sum w_i} \]</p>

            <h3>Example: Valuing a Portfolio</h3>
            <p>An investor buying 100 shares at $10 and 50 shares at $40 has a weighted average price of $20 (total cost $3,000 / 150 shares), which better represents cost basis than the simple average of $25.</p>

            <h3>Using Frequency as Weights</h3>
            <p>Weights correct for sampling bias: if a subgroup is underrepresented among respondents, increase its weight proportional to its population share.</p>

            <h2>Harmonic Mean</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>harmonic mean</strong> is defined as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean
                of the reciprocals of the data values. It is particularly useful when dealing with
                rates or ratios, such as speeds or densities, where the quantities being averaged
                are defined over a fixed unit (e.g., distance or mass).
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ H = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x_i}} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                Compared to the arithmetic and geometric means, the harmonic mean gives
                greater weight to smaller values, making it appropriate when smaller numbers
                have more significance. For example, it accurately describes the average speed
                for a round trip over equal distances.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Quadratic Mean</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>quadratic mean</strong>, also known as the <em>root mean square (RMS)</em>,
                measures the magnitude of a set of values regardless of their sign. It is computed
                as the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squared data values.
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ Q = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 } \]
            </p>

            <p>
                The RMS is widely used in physics and engineering, especially in electrical
                applications to represent the effective value of an alternating current or voltage.
                Unlike the arithmetic mean, it emphasizes larger magnitudes since squaring
                amplifies deviations from zero.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Moving beyond a one-size-fits-all average is essential. Each mean—arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, quadratic, and weighted—serves a distinct analytical purpose. Far from being mere mathematical curiosities, they are precision instruments that reveal different aspects of the data’s structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>Harmonic Mean</strong> excels in averaging rates and ratios, ensuring fairness where smaller values dominate influence, while the <strong>Quadratic Mean (RMS)</strong> captures the true magnitude of varying quantities, indispensable in physics, engineering, and performance evaluation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mastering when and why to apply each mean distinguishes technical competence from analytical insight. Choosing the right mean does not simply yield a number—it determines whether our conclusions are mathematically sound and faithfully represent the reality our data describes.
