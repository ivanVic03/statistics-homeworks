        <h2>What is an Online Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>
            Online algorithms update statistics incrementally as each new observation arrives.
            Instead of recalculating the mean or variance from scratch, they adjust existing estimates
            using simple update rules. This allows the algorithm to process data one point at a time,
            making it ideal for real-time or continuously growing datasets.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Computational Efficiency and Scalability</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional (“batch”) formulas require summing over all data for each update,
            which implies a computational cost of \(O(n)\) per step, so \( O(n^2) \), by the Gauss Law.
            Online algorithms reduce this to \(O(1)\), since each update uses only the new value
            and the previously computed statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
            This efficiency makes them highly scalable for large datasets or streaming applications,
            where reprocessing all data would be computationally infeasible.
            Each update involves only a few arithmetic operations, maintaining constant-time performance
            regardless of the dataset size.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Numerical Stability and Error Propagation</h2>
        <p>
            In numerical analysis, repeated summations and subtractions in batch formulas
            can accumulate rounding errors. This is especially problematic when numbers vary greatly in magnitude.
            Online algorithms, such as Welford’s method for variance,
            minimize these issues by updating only small differences
            between the new observation and the current mean.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach reduces <em>error propagation</em> and avoids catastrophic cancellation,
            which occurs when two nearly equal large numbers are subtracted, causing significant loss of precision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, because only incremental quantities are stored and updated,
            online methods are less prone to overflow or underflow
            when handling large datasets or extreme values.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Robustness and Memory Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
            Online algorithms store only a few running values — for example, the count \(n\),
            the current mean, and \(M_2\) for variance.
            As a result, memory usage remains constant, or \(O(1)\),
            while batch methods must keep the entire dataset in memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            This makes online approaches more robust and adaptable to real-time computation,
            sensor data, or streaming analytics, where data may be unbounded or incomplete.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Summary and Comparison</h2>
        <p>
            Compared to traditional batch algorithms, online methods offer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Constant-time updates — \(O(1)\) complexity per sample.</li>
            <li>Constant memory usage — independent of dataset size.</li>
            <li>Reduced numerical errors and improved stability.</li>
            <li>Resistance to overflow and cancellation effects.</li>
            <li>Scalability and suitability for real-time data streams.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In conclusion, online algorithms combine computational efficiency with numerical robustness,
            offering a reliable and scalable alternative to batch computations,
            particularly in modern applications involving continuous or massive data flows.
