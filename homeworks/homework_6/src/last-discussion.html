        <h2>What is an Online Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>Online algorithms update statistics incrementally as each new observation arrives.
            Instead of recalculating the mean or variance using all previous data points,
            they adjust the current result based on the new value.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Computational Efficiency</h2>
        <p>With traditional (“batch”) formulas, every update requires scanning all data again,
            which has a computational cost of \(O(n)\) for each step.
            Online algorithms reduce this to \(O(1)\), since each update uses only the new value and
            the previously computed statistics.</p>
        <p>This makes them particularly useful when data arrive continuously,
            as in data streams, or when the dataset is too large to fit into memory.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Memory Efficiency</h2>
        <p>In batch methods, all observations must be stored to recompute statistics.
            Online algorithms, instead, store only a few running values (such as count, mean, and M₂ for variance),
            keeping the memory usage constant regardless of dataset size.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Online algorithms provide an elegant and efficient way to handle growing or streaming data:
            they require less memory, are faster to update, and reduce numerical errors caused by repeated summations.
            These advantages make them essential in real-time analytics and large-scale statistical computation.</p>
